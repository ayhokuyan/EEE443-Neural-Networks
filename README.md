# EEE443 Neural Networks
The assignment and project implementations for EEE443 course, Bilkent University.

## Coverage of the repository

### Assignment 1
- Finding the probability distribution of a network with a number of neurons. 
- Building a neural network to perform a simple logic formula. 
- Building a single layer perceptron to learn the representations of letters in the alphabet. 
- Implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook)

### Assignment 2
- Proving the solution of mean squared error loss. 
- Design and implement a neural network from scratch, and train it for a binary classification (car vs cat) problem.  
- Implement a neural network that predicts the fourth word given the initial three. A simple NLP application. 
- Implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook)

### Assignment 3
- Unsupervised feature extraction using a sparse auto-encoders. MSE loss function with the addition of Tikhonov (L2) regularization and KL-Divergence to ensure sparsity. 
- Observation and completion of networks about CNNs, PyTorch and TensorFlow. 
- Implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook) 

###  Project:
- @emredonmez98
- Built an image captioning networks that generates automated captions from an image. 
- A custom Flickr dataset is used. 
- A pretrained Inception V3 is used to extract features from the images. 
- Then, a an attention based RNN decoder (with LSTMs) is trained (initialized with GloVe embeddings) is used to generate captions for the images.
